    <ul>
        <li>We can rely more on renewable energy to reduce greenhouse gas emission.</li>
        <li>We can try to imporve energy efficiency to reduce greenhouse gas emission.</li>
        <li>We can plant more trees helps absorb CO2 reducing greenhouse gas level. </li>
        <li>We can support policies and regulations that regulates activities to reduce greenhouse gas emission.</li>
        <li>We can reduce our energy usage to reduce greenhouse gas emission.</li>
