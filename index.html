    <h2>Why are Glaciers melting?</h2>
    <p>Since the early 1900s, many glaciers around the world have been rapidly melting. 
        Human activities are at the root of this phenomenon. 
        Specifically, since the industrial revolution, 
        carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gas emissions have raised temperatures, 
        even higher in the poles, and as a result, glaciers are rapidly melting, 
        calving off into the sea and retreating on land.</p>
    <h2>What We Can Do</h2>
    <p>1. Reach out to your local elected officials to find out if your city has a disaster response plan for right now</p>
    <p>2. reduce greenhouse gas emissions by using renewable energy</p>
    <p>3. Slow down their erosion</p>
    <p>4. Combine artificial icebergs</p>
    <p>5. Increase their thickness</p>
